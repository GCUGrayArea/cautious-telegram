### ✅ Test Scenario 4: Test Media Availability
**Objective**: Verify test video files are available for manual testing

**Test Steps**:
1. Check `test-media/` directory for test clips
2. Verify variety of resolutions and durations

**Results**:
- ✅ **PASS** - Test media files present

**Available Test Clips**:
- `test-clip-1-5sec-1080p.mp4` (147 KB, 5 seconds)
- `test-clip-2-10sec-1080p.mp4` (293 KB, 10 seconds)
- `test-clip-3-3sec-720p.mp4` (60 KB, 3 seconds)
- `test-clip-4-15sec-1080p.mp4` (12 MB, 15 seconds)
- `test-clip-5-7sec-480p.mp4` (791 KB, 7 seconds)

**Coverage**: Multiple resolutions (480p, 720p, 1080p) and durations (3s to 15s)

---

### ⚠️ Test Scenario 5: Import 3 Clips, Arrange, Trim, Split, Export
**Objective**: Test complete editing workflow from import to export

**Test Steps**:
1. ~~Launch application in dev mode~~
2. ~~Import 3 test video clips via drag-and-drop or file picker~~
3. ~~Verify clips appear in media library with thumbnails~~
4. ~~Drag clips to timeline~~
5. ~~Arrange clips in desired order~~
6. ~~Trim clip edges to adjust duration~~
7. ~~Split a clip at playhead position~~
8. ~~Export timeline to MP4~~
9. ~~Verify exported file plays correctly~~

**Status**: ⚠️ **NOT EXECUTED** - Manual testing requires running Tauri dev server

**Reason**: Automated E2E testing with Tauri requires running the application (`npm run tauri:dev` or `npm run tauri build`). This is outside the scope of this automated QC check which focuses on:
- Unit test verification ✅
- Build verification ✅
- Code quality analysis ✅
- Architecture review ✅

**Recommendation**: Manual testing should be performed by user or dedicated QA session when running the live application.

---

### ⚠️ Test Scenario 6: Record 30s Screen Capture, Add to Timeline, Export
**Objective**: Test screen recording and export workflow

**Status**: ⚠️ **NOT EXECUTED** - Requires live application and user interaction

**Reason**: Screen recording requires:
- Running Tauri application
- User permission for screen capture
- Live browser MediaRecorder API
- Cannot be automated without UI testing framework

**Recommendation**: Manual testing required when application is running.

---

### ⚠️ Test Scenario 7: Simultaneous Screen + Webcam, Edit, Export
**Objective**: Test multi-stream recording

**Status**: ⚠️ **NOT EXECUTED** - Requires live application

**Reason**: Webcam recording requires:
- Running application with camera permissions
- Physical webcam hardware
- User interaction for recording start/stop

**Recommendation**: Manual testing required.

---

### ⚠️ Test Scenario 8: Timeline with 10+ Clips Responsiveness
**Objective**: Verify timeline performance with many clips

**Status**: ⚠️ **NOT EXECUTED** - Requires live application

**Expected Performance** (based on code analysis):
- Konva.js canvas rendering: Optimized for 10+ clips
- Timeline utility functions: O(n) complexity for clip operations
- Snap points calculation: Efficient with array operations
- Should maintain 60fps UI with proper Konva layer management

**Recommendation**: Performance testing should be done with live application and performance profiling tools.

---

### ⚠️ Test Scenario 9: Export 2-Minute Video with Multiple Clips
**Objective**: Test export with longer timeline

**Status**: ⚠️ **NOT EXECUTED** - Requires live application and video files

**Expected Behavior** (based on code analysis):
- FFmpeg pipeline: Trim → Concatenate → Re-encode
- Progress tracking: Arc<Mutex<ExportProgress>> in Rust backend
- Resolution options: Source, 720p, 1080p
- Quality: CRF 23 (H.264), AAC 192k audio

**Recommendation**: Export testing requires running application with actual timeline content.

---

### ⚠️ Test Scenario 10: App Stability (15-Minute Session)
**Objective**: Verify no memory leaks or crashes during extended use

**Status**: ⚠️ **NOT EXECUTED** - Requires live application

**Code Analysis for Stability**:
- ✅ Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks (cleanup functions present)
- ✅ PlaybackEngine destroy() method for resource cleanup
- ✅ Recording cleanup on component unmount
- ✅ No obvious memory leak patterns in code
- ✅ Rust backend uses proper RAII patterns

**Recommendation**: Stability testing requires running application for extended period with memory profiling.

---

## Bugs Discovered

### None Found ✅

No critical bugs were discovered during automated testing. All unit tests pass, both builds succeed, and code quality analysis reveals a well-structured codebase.

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Collision Detection (Non-Critical)
**Location**: `src/utils/timeline.js:206-214` - `constrainClipPosition()` function
**Status**: TODO - Not yet implemented
**Impact**: ⚠️ Low - Clips can currently overlap on the same track
**Workaround**: Users can manually position clips to avoid overlaps
**Priority**: Medium enhancement for future release

### 2. Manual Testing Required
**Scope**: End-to-end workflows with live application
**Affected Scenarios**:
- Import/export workflows (Scenarios 5, 9)
- Recording workflows (Scenarios 6, 7)
- Performance testing (Scenario 8)
- Stability testing (Scenario 10)

**Reason**: Tauri desktop applications require running `tauri:dev` or `tauri build` for live testing. Automated E2E testing would require:
- Selenium/WebDriver for Tauri
- Mock camera/screen capture APIs
- Video file fixtures and playback validation
- This is beyond the scope of MVP sprint (72-hour deadline)

**Recommendation**: User acceptance testing or dedicated QA session with running application.

2. **Add E2E Testing Framework**: Consider Playwright or Selenium for Tauri app testing
3. **Performance Profiling**: Test with 20+ clips and longer videos
4. **Add Integration Tests**: Test database operations, FFmpeg commands, and recording APIs
5. **Error Recovery**: Add auto-save and crash recovery features
