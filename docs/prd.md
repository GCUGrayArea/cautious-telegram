  - Decode input formats (MP4, MOV, WebM, etc.)
  - Encode output (H.264 MP4)
  - Trim, concatenate, overlay operations
  - Extract frames for thumbnails
  - Embedded FFmpeg binary (via Tauri side-loading or @ffmpeg/ffmpeg)

#### Database
- **SQLite**: Embedded database via Tauri
  - Store media library metadata
  - Store project files (timeline state, clip references)
  - Store user settings
  - No server required, portable database file

#### Video Player
- **HTML5 `<video>` element**: Native video playback
  - Fast, hardware-accelerated
  - Standard web API
  - Good format support
  - Easy integration with preview system

### Architecture

#### Frontend Architecture
- **Component structure**:
  - `App`: Root component, routing, global state
  - `MediaLibrary`: Grid/list of imported clips
  - `Timeline`: Konva-based timeline editor
  - `PreviewPlayer`: Video preview window
  - `RecordingControls`: Screen/webcam recording UI
  - `ExportDialog`: Export configuration and progress
- **State management**: Preact hooks (useState, useReducer, useContext) or lightweight state library (Zustand, Valtio)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules for scoped styles

#### Backend Architecture (Tauri Rust)
- **Commands** (Rust functions invoked from frontend):
  - `import_video(path)`: Import video file, extract metadata, generate thumbnail
  - `get_media_library()`: Query all media from SQLite
  - `delete_media(id)`: Remove media from library
  - `start_screen_recording(options)`: Start screen capture
  - `start_webcam_recording(options)`: Start webcam capture
  - `stop_recording()`: Stop recording, save file
  - `export_video(timeline, settings)`: Run FFmpeg export process
  - `get_export_progress()`: Poll export progress
- **Database layer**: SQLite via `rusqlite` or `sqlx`
  - Tables: `media` (id, path, duration, resolution, size, thumbnail_path, created_at)
  - Tables: `projects` (id, name, timeline_json, created_at, updated_at)
- **File system**: Access local files, manage temp files for recordings
- **FFmpeg integration**: Execute FFmpeg CLI or use Rust bindings

#### Data Flow
1. **Import**: User drags file â†’ Frontend calls `import_video()` â†’ Backend extracts metadata, saves to DB â†’ Frontend updates media library
2. **Timeline Edit**: User drags clip â†’ Frontend updates Konva objects â†’ State updated in memory
3. **Preview**: Playhead moves â†’ Frontend calculates which clip(s) visible â†’ Updates `<video>` element source/currentTime
4. **Export**: User clicks export â†’ Frontend sends timeline JSON + settings to backend â†’ Backend runs FFmpeg â†’ Frontend polls progress â†’ Completion notification

### Integration Points

#### External Services (Optional)
- **Google Drive API**: OAuth2 authentication, upload video file
- **Dropbox API**: OAuth2 authentication, upload video file
- **Analytics** (if desired): Track feature usage, errors

#### System APIs
- **macOS AVFoundation**: Screen/window capture via Tauri Rust commands
- **Windows Graphics.Capture**: Screen capture via Tauri Rust commands
- **getUserMedia/getDisplayMedia**: Webcam and fallback screen capture (web API)

### Performance Requirements

- **App Launch**: Under 5 seconds from click to usable interface
- **Timeline Responsiveness**: Smooth drag/drop with 10+ clips (60 fps UI)
- **Preview Playback**: 30+ fps minimum, ideally 60 fps
- **Export Speed**: Real-time or faster (1-minute video exports in â‰¤60 seconds)
- **Memory**: No leaks during 15+ minute sessions, reasonable memory usage (< 1GB for typical project)
- **File Size**: Exported videos maintain quality without bloat (comparable to source bitrate)

### Security and Privacy

- **File Access**: Only access files user explicitly imports or chooses
- **Permissions**: Request camera/microphone permissions only when needed
- **Data Storage**: Store media references (paths), not full video files in database
- **No Telemetry**: No data collection unless user opts in

### Data Persistence

- **Project Files**: Save timeline state (clip arrangements, trim points, effects) as JSON in SQLite
- **Media Library**: Persist imported media metadata in SQLite
- **Settings**: User preferences (default export quality, shortcuts) in SQLite or config file
- **Auto-save**: Periodically save project state to prevent data loss (future enhancement)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Scalability
- Support timelines with 20+ clips without performance degradation
- Handle video files up to 4K resolution
- Support videos up to 2 hours duration per clip

### Reliability and Availability
- Graceful error handling (corrupted files, missing codecs, disk full)
- Auto-save project state every 2 minutes
- Crash recovery: reload last saved state on restart
- No data loss during export failures (preserve source files)

### Platform Compatibility
- **Primary**: Windows 10/11 and macOS 11+
- **Testing**: Test on both platforms if possible
- **Native Features**: Use platform-specific APIs where beneficial (AVFoundation on macOS, WGC on Windows)

### Accessibility
- Keyboard shortcuts for all major actions (spacebar, arrow keys, Del, Ctrl+Z)
- Clear visual feedback (hover states, selection highlights)
- Adequate color contrast for UI elements
- Future: Screen reader support, keyboard-only navigation

## Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly **not included** in this 72-hour sprint to prevent scope creep:

- Advanced video effects (color grading, chroma key, blur, etc.)
- Animated text overlays with custom fonts
- Complex transitions (anything beyond cut or simple fade)
- Audio editing (volume envelopes, fade curves, equalizer)
- Multi-user collaboration or cloud projects
- Mobile app version
- Plugin architecture or third-party extensions
- Advanced export formats (ProRes, AVI, etc.)
- Live streaming capabilities
- AI-powered features (auto-captions, scene detection, etc.)
- Template library or pre-built project templates
- Social media direct uploads (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram APIs)
- Advanced project management (folders, tags, search)
- Multi-language support (localization)
- Custom keyboard shortcut configuration

These features can be considered for future iterations after the initial launch.

## Project Timeline

- **Monday, October 27th**: Project start, planning, and initial setup
- **Tuesday, October 28th, 10:59 PM CT**: MVP checkpoint (hard gate)
- **Wednesday, October 29th, 10:59 PM CT**: Final submission deadline
- **Thursday, October 30th**: Relocation to Austin

**Total development time: 72 hours**

This is an aggressive timeline. Focus relentlessly on the core loop: **Record â†’ Import â†’ Arrange â†’ Export**. A simple, working video editor beats a feature-rich app that crashes.
